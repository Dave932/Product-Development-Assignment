Final DATA 824 project


The Universal bank's dataset includes data on 5000 customers. the data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc...), customers' responses to the last personal loan campaign, and customers' relations with the bank( mortgage, security account, etc..). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 accepted personal loans in the previous campaign. 
The goal is to build a model that identifies customers who are most likely to accept the loan offers in future mailings.
I start binning the income variable into 3 categories so that I have a better chance of visualizing it.
Source of the dataset: Kaggle or University of California, school of information and Computer Science machine learning repository.
